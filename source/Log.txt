May 13th, 2018,
Added a GUI enabled option to include or not include ellipsoids in the calculations.
changes took place, in:
1- UI_VIEW_PT
added:
row4_step2.prop(scene,'prop_bool_ellipsoids')

2- the variable needs to be defined/initialized in:
register() and unregister()


3- in func_load_objectsNames(self)
bpy.types.Scene.prop_bool_ellipsoid = bpy.props.BoolProperty(name="Draw Ellipsoids")

4- put the if condition in invoke for class OBJECTS_OT_generate_clusters(bpy.types.Operator):
if bpy.context.scene.prop_bool_ellipsoid == True:	
							self.draw_ellipsoid(dlabel,ellip_color)
                            

5- we used that flag (bpy.context.scene.prop_bool_ellipsoid) for the fix_precision function, no need to make any
amendments, since the ellipsoids will not be drawn:
code snippet:
	# special case for 3X3 matrices ellipsoids:
					if len(cluster_points) == 3 and bpy.context.scene.prop_bool_ellipsoid==True:
						print('self.np_points_ before',self.np_points_)	
						self.fix_precision(cluster_points)
						print('self.np_points_ after',self.np_points_)


14th May 2018:
all blender versions should launch without the need to set any environment variables manually from console. 
blender 2.79b has been tested successfuly on Windows 10. running Anaconda3, with one custom conda environment using the command:
conda create -n env_py353_blen279b python=3.5.3

the script was then modified to re-assign sys.path in such way that our newly created conda python libraries are checked first. This is to prevent blender from
accessing its own version of similar modules such as numpy that was included with Blender's python bundle since version 2.7x. 
In our case, blender 2.79b had numpy version â€˜1.10.1', while a fresh install of python3.5.3 would have numpy 1.14.3. hence, we needed to put our local libraries
in the assignement order first, so that code execution goes with our version of numpy, which is 1.14.3. This change have managed to eleminate 
the recent error with calculating ellipsoids and drawing them.

The script has been tested successfuly on Mac and Linux.
